Natalie: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], there customer!
- I need to buy a stronger sword (1800 gold)
	if has_sword:
		Natalie: You already have a sword. That is the best I can get you.
	elif has_money==false:
		Natalie: You don't seem to have enough gold yet.
	elif has_money:

	Natalie: Okay, see you next time!
